# Reaction-Time-Test
Reaction Time Tester is a fun and interactive web app that helps you measure how quickly you can respond to visual stimuli. When you click the "Start" button, a colored box appears after a random delay. Your task is to click the box as fast as you can once it appears â€” your reaction time will then be displayed in milliseconds.
